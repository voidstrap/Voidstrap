## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Can it get you banned?

No. Voidstrap does not inject cheats, exploits, or bypass Roblox security.  
It functions as a launcher and configuration manager. However, as with any third-party tool, use it at your own discretion.

---

### Is it a virus?

No. Voidstrap is fully open-source, meaning anyone can inspect the code.  
If your antivirus flags it, it is most likely a false positive due to how launchers interact with Roblox processes and updates. You can verify the source code yourself at:
